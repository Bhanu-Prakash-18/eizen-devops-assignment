# Task 7 – Monitoring with Grafana

Grafana can be used to monitor both Kubernetes clusters and local systems.

## Kubernetes Metrics
- Node CPU and memory usage
- Pod CPU and memory usage
- Pod restarts
- Namespace-level resource consumption

## Local System Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk usage

## Setup (Production)
- Prometheus used as data source
- Grafana dashboards visualize metrics

## Notes
Grafana setup and dashboards are documented as design approach due to time constraints.
